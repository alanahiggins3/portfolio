I was born and raised on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. After graduating from high school in 2015, I moved to the Central Coast of California to attend California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. I majored in Environmental Earth and Soil Science with an emphasis in geospatial technologies. Some of my other academic interests included geography, graphic design, and urban planning.

During my time at Cal Poly, I became part of the San Luis Obispo community. I was a GIS intern at the County Department of Public Works, where I worked on projects relating to water resources and county surveying. Additionally, I've created maps for professors and friends utilizing my geospatial skills. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in June 2019. 

I recently finished an internship at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California through the [NASA DEVELOP National Program](https://develop.larc.nasa.gov/). DEVELOP is part of NASA's Applied Science and Capacity Building program, and provides young professionals with remote sensing and professional development experience.

My other interests include jewelry making, swimming, hiking, and cooking.
