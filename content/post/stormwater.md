A stormwater management plan is a necessary precaution many construction companies must take to ensure that the new development considers the runoff of natural storms or weather disturbances. In this fictional report done as part of my Soil Erosion and Water Conservation course (ERSC 303) at Cal Poly, I analyzed the infiltration capacity of a stormwater runoff site near university dorms. 

I used a combination of field work and geostatistical analysis to determine infiltration rates. The field measurements required using infiltrometers to measure water flow rates and taking soil samples back to a lab to determine the soil's bulk density. These values were compared to geostatistical analysis done in ESRI ArcMap Desktop. I used the Bayesian Empirical Kriging tool to extract infiltration rates based on slope. In addition to Bayesian Kriging, I also performed a Spline interpolation.
