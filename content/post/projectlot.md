This report was created as part of a midterm exam in my Applied GIS (NR 418) course at Cal Poly. The main objective was to determine the areas within city project lots that fit certain criteria. To do so, I used ArcMap ModelBuilder to identify sections of land that had specific aspect and slope values.
