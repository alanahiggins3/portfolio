During my second term with the NASA DEVELOP program, I was part of a Water Resources project. Over ten weeks, my team and I created a Google Earth Engine dashboard to analyze water quality parameters of the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System in Central America. Our main objective was to support the environmental decision making efforts of our international partners, the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Coastal Zone Management Authority and Institute.

The two parameters we studied were turbidity (water clarity) and chlorophyll-a (water color) concentrations, which are characteristics used as proxy data to determine water and reef health. To detect and map turbidity and chlorophyll-a over the course of several years, we applied different algorithms to satellite imagery from Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-2 MSI, and Aqua + Terra MODIS.

Results were displayed in an intuitive and interactive user interface designed for future use by our partners. Time series graphs were generated to visualize changing turbidity and chlorophyll levels over time and are downloadable as CSV, SVG, and PNG files.

The tool is currently undergoing a software release process and is not yet available for public use, however, a brief demo is available on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/352085898).
