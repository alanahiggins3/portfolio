This report was created as part of a midterm exam in my Applied GIS (NR 418) course at Cal Poly. The objective was to find a suitable habitat for a fictional species that could only thrive in highly specific conditions. To do so, I used the ArcMap ModelBuilder to locate possible habitats within the Poly Canyon Watershed.
