Construction is a primary source of soil erosion and hydrologic degradation. This report assesses the post-construction environment of a newly built apartment complex by comparing the pre-construction hydrology to post-construction hydrology. Specifically, runoff and peak flow values are calculated to draw conclusions about the impact of anthropogenic disturbance. This report was written as a component of my Soil Erosion and Water Conservation (ERSC 303) course at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 

Low impact development (LID) features are systems or practices that mimic natural processes and facilitate the movement of water and soil to maintain a balanced environment (i.e. vegetative swales, retention basins, pervious pavement, green roofs, etc.). LID features have been built into the apartment complex and taken into account by the Post-Construction Water Balance Calculator. By taking this holistic approach to understand both natural and man-made development, a more accurate assessment of the site can be made.
