The Lopez Lake Recreation Area is a popular gathering place for outdoor enthusiasts on the Central Coast of California. For this project, a team of nine Cal Poly students, including myself, visited the site to conduct field work and collect GPS coordinates of all campsites and utility features in the park. We utilized the Trible Geo 7x GPS unit and Pathfinder software to collect and process the data. Additionally, we used ArcMap Desktop 10.5 to visualize the data and create maps for public distribution.

We worked closely with park ranger, Lenny Cridebring, to ensure the maps fulfilled park staff objectives and could be relied upon for future reference.
