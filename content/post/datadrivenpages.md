Urbanized areas are often difficult to represent spatially as cities have high population densities and land use can change frequently. Data Driven Pages is a useful tool in the ArcMap toolbox that allows users to break up the area of their city page by page. Each page represents one square unit of an entire city grid. By including an inset map, users can gauge where they are within the city for better context. For an assignment in my Applied GIS class (NR 418), I created a twenty-page document that breaks down the city of San Luis Obispo, CA in this very way. Here is page twelve of twenty.
