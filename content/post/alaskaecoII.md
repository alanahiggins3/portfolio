During this ten week internship, I was the project lead in a team of educated young professionals with backgrounds in remote sensing, GIS, comuter science,data analysis, and of course, a passion for the environment. 

Our project aimed to analyze wetland inundation in the state of Alaska using synthetic arperture radar (SAR) and optical imagery from Sentinel-1 and Landsat 8 satellite data. We built on the previous team's SAR Wetland Extent Exploration Tool (SWEET), a Python-based algorithm that detected inundation type based on seasonality and vegetation. 

We worked with federal partners at the US Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory as well as researchers at the Alaska Satellite Facility. Our main objective was to act as the scientific foundation that would ground future environmental decisions and to present our partners with a viable tool.
