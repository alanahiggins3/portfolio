A Phase I Environmental Site Assessment is a common evaluation done to identify environmental hazards or liabilities on a property. They are often required for land appraisals, real estate transactions, or building development. Common hazards include leaking gas or septic tanks, contaminated wells, and improperly stored chemicals, as these substances may seep into groundwater basins or public waterways. 

This report was the final project for my Environmental Applications of Soils Science (SSC 562), a graduate level course taken remotely through North Carolina State University. I was given a description of a foreclosed property that the bank had planned to excavate and develop. Based on my knowledge of volatile contaminants, surface and groundwater movement, and methods of spatial analysis, I performed this fictional assessment for a property in Paso Robles, California.
