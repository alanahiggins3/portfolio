title: How I Built This Website in R Studio
---

I created this website in RStudio using Blogdown and Hugo packages. The code for this theme was written by Huabing Zhao, and is available [here](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-cleanwhite/). My edits are available on [Github](https://github.com/alanahiggins3/alana-portfolio).
