title: How I Built This Website in R Studio
---

I created this website in RStudio using the Blogdown and Hugo packages. The code I wrote is available on [Github](https://github.com/alanahiggins3/alana-portfolio). The theme used for this website is called, "Clean White" and was written by Huabing Zhao. It is available [here](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-cleanwhite/)
