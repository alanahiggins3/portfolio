For my second term with the NASA DEVELOP program, I was part of a Water Resources team. Over ten weeks, my team and I created a Google Earth Engine dashboard to analyze water quality parameters of the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System in Central America. 

The two parameters we studied were turbidity (water clarity) and chlorophyll-a (water color) concentrations, which are characterisitcs used as proxy data to determine water and reef health. To detect and map turbidity and chlorophyll-a over the course of several years, we applied different algorithms to satellite imagery from Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-2 MSI, and Aqua + Terra MODIS. 

Results were displayed in an intuitive and interactive user interface designed for future use by our international partners located in Belize. Time series analyses were generated to visualize changing turbidity and chlorophyll levels over time and are available for download through the tool. 

The tool is currently undergoing a software release process and its code is not yet available for public use, however, a brief demo is avialable here.
