As an active member in my university's GIS community, I aided Dr. Christopher Appel of the Natural Resources and Environmental Science Department in creating soil maps for his ongoing research project of soils in the Me Wuk Tribe Ranch. I created three maps visualizing soil groupings, soil pH values, and potential soil vigor.

I was initially given paper maps with polygons drawn by hand deliniating soil type. Using ArcMap Desktop 10.6, I created a file geodatabase where I digitized the hand-drawn polygons and populated all desired fields. His published work is now completed and I have been cited for my contributions.
